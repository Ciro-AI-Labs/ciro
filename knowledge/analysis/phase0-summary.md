# Phase 0: Preparation - Implementation Summary

We have successfully implemented all the preparation tools required for Phase 0 of the RAG system overhaul as specified in the Extended Plan. Here's a summary of what has been accomplished:

## 1. Documentation & Analysis

### Map Current Codebase
- Created dependency graph visualization for server (`server-dependency-graph.svg`)
- Created dependency graph visualization for frontend (`frontend-graph.svg`)
- Set up a repeatable process to update these visualizations using `npm run analyze:deps`

### Database Schema Analysis
- Implemented `schema-analyzer.ts` to:
  - Extract table and column information from the database
  - Generate comprehensive schema reports in markdown format
  - Create entity-relationship diagrams using Mermaid
  - Save raw schema data for further analysis
  - Produce detailed statistics on table and index sizes
- Added a script to run schema analysis using `npm run analyze:schema`

### Performance Baseline Measurement
- Implemented `performance-monitoring.ts` utility that:
  - Measures RAG query performance metrics (time, document count, etc.)
  - Calculates average similarity scores
  - Estimates token usage costs
  - Generates performance reports
- Created a test script `rag-performance-test.ts` to:
  - Run simulated queries against mock RAG functions
  - Store performance metrics for baseline comparison
  - Generate detailed performance reports
- Added a script to run performance tests using `npm run analyze:performance`

### Mock Database Schema Analysis
- Created `mock-schema-analyzer.ts` to generate representative schema data without database connection
- Generated sample schema reports, ER diagrams, and raw data files
- Simulated table statistics and relationships for RAG system tables
- Added a script to run mock schema analysis using `npm run analyze:mock-schema`

## 2. Environment Setup

- Installed necessary dependencies:
  - `madge` for dependency visualization
  - `pg` for database connectivity
  - `dotenv` for environment configuration
  - `typescript` and `ts-node` for TypeScript support
- Created an analysis directory structure
- Added npm scripts for easy execution of analysis tools
- Documented the process in README files
- Created TypeScript configuration for analysis tools
- Fixed module scope issues using TypeScript namespaces
- Implemented proper type annotations to avoid TypeScript errors
- Created a unified analysis command that runs all tools

## 3. Next Steps

With the preparation phase complete, we are now ready to proceed to Phase 1: Core Architecture Refactoring. The baseline measurements and documentation created during Phase 0 will serve as:

1. Reference points for evaluating improvements
2. Documentation of the current system architecture
3. Guides for identifying performance bottlenecks
4. Indicators of areas needing improvement

### To Start Phase 1:

1. Review the dependency graphs to understand current codebase structure
2. Analyze the schema reports to identify database optimization opportunities
3. Study the performance metrics to target areas for improvement
4. Implement the enhanced retrieval service with chunking capabilities as specified in Phase 1, Step 1

### Technical Notes for Future Development

1. TypeScript Considerations:
   - Use namespaces to prevent variable conflicts in analysis scripts
   - Explicitly type all parameters in callback functions
   - Add proper error handling with type annotations for unknown errors

2. Database Connectivity:
   - Database analysis can be run on production systems with credentials
   - For development without database access, the mock schema analyzer provides representative data
   - Update connection parameters in .env files for database connectivity

The preparation tools have been designed to be run multiple times during the project to track progress and verify improvements.
