# TypeORM to Prisma Migration PRD

## Project Overview
This project aims to migrate an existing NestJS application from TypeORM to Prisma as the ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) tool. The application is a data analysis platform with features for document processing, analytics, AI integrations, and user management. The migration must be completed in a phased approach to ensure continuous functionality throughout the transition.

## Current Architecture
- NestJS backend with TypeORM integration
- PostgreSQL database with multiple entities and relationships
- Authentication system with JWT
- Document processing pipeline with job queues
- AI/NLP services for data analysis

## Migration Goals
1. Replace all TypeORM entities with Prisma models
2. Update all services to use PrismaService instead of TypeORM repositories
3. Ensure all queries and relationships work correctly
4. Remove TypeORM dependencies and configuration
5. Validate that all features continue to work as expected
6. Improve performance where possible through Prisma's optimizations

## Requirements

### Phase 1: Setup and Planning
- Initialize Prisma in the project
- Generate Prisma schema from existing database
- Create migration plan and task breakdown
- Set up PrismaService for dependency injection

### Phase 2: Core Services Migration
- Migrate authentication service
- Migrate user and organization services
- Migrate data source management
- Update core modules and controllers

### Phase 3: Feature Services Migration
- Migrate document processing services
- Migrate analytics services
- Migrate AI/NLP services
- Update feature modules and controllers

### Phase 4: Testing and Cleanup
- Verify all features work as expected
- Remove unused TypeORM imports and dependencies
- Update documentation
- Perform final testing and validation

## Technical Constraints
- The database schema should remain compatible
- API endpoints should maintain the same behavior
- The migration should support existing data
- Transactions should be preserved where used
- Authentication and authorization must be maintained
- Performance should be maintained or improved

## Success Criteria
- All tests pass with Prisma integration
- No TypeORM dependencies remain in the codebase
- Application functions correctly with Prisma
- No regression in performance
- All API endpoints maintain the same behavior

## Timeline
The migration should be completed within 4 weeks, with each phase taking approximately 1 week.
