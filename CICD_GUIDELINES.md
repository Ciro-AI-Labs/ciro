# CI/CD Guidelines

This document outlines the Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment/Delivery (CD) guidelines for this project. Adhering to these practices will help ensure code quality, automate processes, and streamline deployments.

## 1. Branching Strategy

We will adopt a branching strategy inspired by GitFlow, focusing on clarity and stability.

*   **`main` (or `master`)**:
    *   This branch represents the production-ready code.
    *   Only stable, tested, and reviewed code should be merged into `main`.
    *   Direct pushes to `main` should be prohibited or heavily restricted. Merges should happen via Pull Requests (PRs) from `develop` (for releases) or `hotfix/*` branches.
    *   Each merge to `main` should ideally correspond to a release and be tagged with a version number (e.g., `v1.0.0`).

*   **`develop`**:
    *   This is the primary integration branch for ongoing development.
    *   All feature branches are merged into `develop` after review and passing CI checks.
    *   This branch should always be in a state that could potentially be released to staging.
    *   When `develop` is stable and ready for a release, it's merged into `main`.

*   **`feature/<feature-name>`** (e.g., `feature/threads-tab-ui`):
    *   Branched from `develop`.
    *   Used for developing new features.
    *   Should be kept relatively short-lived.
    *   Once a feature is complete, it's merged back into `develop` via a PR.
    *   Regularly rebase or merge `develop` into your feature branch to stay up-to-date and resolve conflicts early.

*   **`bugfix/<issue-number-or-description>`** (e.g., `bugfix/login-error-500`):
    *   Branched from `develop`.
    *   Used for fixing non-critical bugs discovered during development or in the staging environment.
    *   Merged back into `develop` via a PR.

*   **`hotfix/<issue-number-or-description>`** (e.g., `hotfix/critical-security-patch`):
    *   Branched from `main`.
    *   Used for fixing critical bugs found in production that need an immediate fix.
    *   Once the hotfix is complete and tested, it must be merged back into both `main` (for immediate deployment) and `develop` (to ensure the fix is included in future releases). This merge into `main` should also be tagged.

### Pull Request (PR) Process:

*   All merges into `develop` and `main` (and `hotfix` branches if used collaboratively) must be done via Pull Requests.
*   PRs should have a clear title and description of the changes.
*   PRs must pass all CI checks (linting, tests, build).
*   At least one code review from another team member is recommended before merging, especially for `develop` and `main`.
*   Delete the source branch after merging the PR to keep the repository clean.

## 2. Commit Message Conventions

Adopt [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) to create an explicit commit history, which makes it easier to track changes and automate changelog generation.

The basic format is:
`<type>[optional scope]: <description>`

Common types:
*   `feat`: A new feature.
*   `fix`: A bug fix.
*   `docs`: Documentation only changes.
*   `style`: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc).
*   `refactor`: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature.
*   `perf`: A code change that improves performance.
*   `test`: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests.
*   `build`: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies (example scopes: gulp, broccoli, npm).
*   `ci`: Changes to CI configuration files and scripts.
*   `chore`: Other changes that don't modify `src` or `test` files (e.g., updating dependencies).
*   `revert`: Reverts a previous commit.

Example:
`feat(api): add endpoint for user authentication`
`fix(ui): correct button alignment on login page`

## 3. Continuous Integration (CI)

CI pipelines automate the process of building, testing, and validating code changes.

*   **Trigger:**
    *   On every push to `feature/*`, `bugfix/*`, `hotfix/*` branches.
    *   On every Pull Request targeting `develop` or `main`.

*   **CI Pipeline Steps:**
    1.  **Checkout Code:** Get the latest version of the code from the branch/PR.
    2.  **Setup Environment:**
        *   Set up the correct Node.js version.
        *   Cache dependencies (e.g., `node_modules`) for faster builds.
    3.  **Install Dependencies:** Run `npm install` (or `yarn install`).
    4.  **Linting:** Run linters (e.g., ESLint, Prettier) to enforce code style and catch syntax errors.
        *   Example command: `npm run lint`
    5.  **Unit Tests:** Run unit tests (e.g., Jest, Mocha).
        *   Example command: `npm run test` or `npm run test:unit`
    6.  **Integration Tests (if applicable):** Run integration tests.
        *   Example command: `npm run test:integration`
    7.  **Build Project:** Compile TypeScript, bundle assets, etc.
        *   Example command: `npm run build`
    8.  **(Optional) Code Quality/Security Scans:**
        *   Tools like SonarQube, CodeClimate, Snyk can be integrated.
    9.  **(Optional) Build Docker Image:** If using Docker, build the image and push it to a container registry (e.g., GHCR, Docker Hub, AWS ECR). This image can be used for subsequent deployment stages.
    10. **Notifications:** Report the status of the CI pipeline (success/failure) to the SCM platform (e.g., as a check on a PR) and/or via notifications (Slack, email).

## 4. Continuous Deployment/Delivery (CD)

CD automates the release of software to various environments.

### Staging Environment:

*   **Purpose:** A pre-production environment that mirrors production as closely as possible. Used for final testing, UAT, and demos.
*   **Trigger:** Typically, automatically on every successful merge to the `develop` branch.
*   **Deployment Steps:**
    1.  Fetch the latest build artifact (e.g., from the CI build of `develop` or a Docker image).
    2.  Deploy to the staging server/platform (e.g., AWS, Vercel, Netlify, Kubernetes cluster).
    3.  Run database migrations (if applicable).
    4.  Perform health checks.
    5.  **(Optional) Automated End-to-End (E2E) Tests:** Run E2E tests (e.g., Cypress, Playwright) against the staging environment.
*   **Access:** Accessible to the development team, QA, and stakeholders.

### Production Environment:

*   **Purpose:** The live environment used by end-users.
*   **Trigger:**
    *   Typically, manually triggered after successful validation on the staging environment.
    *   Alternatively, can be automated upon a successful merge to `main` if a high degree of confidence is achieved through automated testing.
*   **Deployment Steps:**
    1.  Fetch the latest build artifact from the `main` branch (or a tagged release).
    2.  Deploy to the production server/platform.
        *   **Consider Deployment Strategies:**
            *   **Blue/Green Deployment:** Deploy to a new identical environment and switch traffic once it's verified. Allows for easy rollback.
            *   **Canary Release:** Gradually roll out the new version to a small subset of users before a full rollout.
            *   **Rolling Update:** Gradually update instances one by one or in batches.
    3.  Run database migrations (if applicable, with caution and rollback plans).
    4.  Perform health checks.
    5.  Monitor closely after deployment for any issues.

## 5. Tooling Suggestions

*   **Source Control Management (SCM):** Git (hosted on GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, etc.)
*   **CI/CD Platforms:**
    *   **GitHub Actions:** Excellent integration if your code is hosted on GitHub.
    *   **GitLab CI/CD:** Powerful and well-integrated if using GitLab.
    *   **Jenkins:** Highly flexible and extensible, often self-hosted.
    *   **CircleCI:** Popular cloud-based CI/CD service.
    *   **Travis CI:** Another well-known cloud-based CI/CD service.
*   **Containerization:** Docker (for consistent environments and deployments).
*   **Container Registry:** Docker Hub, GitHub Container Registry (GHCR), AWS ECR, Google Artifact Registry, Azure Container Registry.
*   **Linting/Formatting:** ESLint, Prettier.
*   **Testing Frameworks:** Jest (popular for React/Node.js), Mocha, Cypress, Playwright.
*   **Build Tools:** `npm scripts`, Webpack, Rollup, `tsc` (TypeScript Compiler).

## 6. Secrets Management

Sensitive information like API keys, database credentials, and other secrets should never be hardcoded in the repository.

*   **CI/CD Platform Secrets:** Most CI/CD platforms (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, etc.) provide a way to store encrypted secrets that can be securely injected into your pipeline as environment variables.
*   **Vault Solutions:** For more advanced secrets management, consider tools like HashiCorp Vault.
*   **`.env` files:** Use `.env` files for local development (ensure `.env` is in your `.gitignore`). For deployed environments, use the platform's secret management capabilities.

## 7. Example CI Workflow (Conceptual GitHub Actions)

Here's a simplified conceptual example for a Node.js/TypeScript project using GitHub Actions:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/ci.yml
name: CI Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - develop
      - feature/**
      - bugfix/**
      - hotfix/**
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - develop
      - main

jobs:
  build_and_test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        node-version: [18.x, 20.x] # Example: test on multiple Node versions

    steps:
    - name: Checkout repository
      uses: actions/checkout@v3

    - name: Set up Node.js ${{ matrix.node-version }}
      uses: actions/setup-node@v3
      with:
        node-version: ${{ matrix.node-version }}
        cache: 'npm' # or 'yarn'

    - name: Install dependencies
      run: npm ci # or yarn install --frozen-lockfile

    - name: Lint code
      run: npm run lint

    - name: Run unit tests
      run: npm run test

    - name: Build project
      run: npm run build

    # Optional: Docker build & push
    # - name: Login to Docker Hub
    #   if: github.event_name == 'push' && github.ref == 'refs/heads/develop' # Example: only push for develop branch
    #   uses: docker/login-action@v2
    #   with:
    #     username: ${{ secrets.DOCKERHUB_USERNAME }}
    #     password: ${{ secrets.DOCKERHUB_TOKEN }}
    # - name: Build and push Docker image
    #   if: github.event_name == 'push' && github.ref == 'refs/heads/develop'
    #   uses: docker/build-push-action@v4
    #   with:
    #     context: .
    #     push: true
    #     tags: yourusername/your-app:develop-${{ github.sha }}
```

## 8. Review and Iteration

These guidelines are a starting point. The CI/CD process should be:
*   **Reviewed regularly:** Ensure it still meets the project's needs.
*   **Iterated upon:** Improve and adapt the pipelines as the project evolves, new tools become available, or better practices are identified.
*   **Owned by the team:** Everyone should understand the CI/CD process and contribute to its maintenance.

By implementing these CI/CD practices, the team can achieve faster feedback loops, higher code quality, more reliable releases, and increased development velocity.
